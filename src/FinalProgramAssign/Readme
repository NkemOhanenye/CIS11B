PAC-PERSON

Write a Java program to create your vision of a PACMAN based computer game.

It should demonstrate Object Oriented Design/Programming.

This includes using inheritance (is-a) and containment (has-a) relationships.

As an example the ghosts, and PAC-PEOPLE could all derive from a GameCharater parent class.

Walls, and Power Pills, like Ghosts and PAC-PEOPLE, are drawn and have positions, but do not move. An interface might be aw good choice to relate all drawable objects.

You should have a game board (GUI components such as JFrame, JPanel, JButtons, and Key pad actions, etc)

You may want a score keeper.

You will want to animate your moving objects with the Timer, use drawing with paintComponent, etc.

Additional labs exercises will be developed to help in your design.
