The long awaited first homework assignment.

Programming Assignment #1

 A warm-up assignment using Strings.

 You have been hired to write a Java Program to check the strength of user passwords.

 This program will demonstrate

/*
 * use of Strings (an implied array),
 * using a loop,
 * decisions to test for each rule
 * boolean flag variables
 * class definition with a constructor, several methods
 * The rules are simple.
 */

 1.  Passwords must be at least 8 characters long.
 //They must contain at least one (1) of each of the following:
 2.  An uppercase letter
 3.  A lowercase letter
 4.  A digit (0..9)
 5.  A “special character” e.g. one that is neither a letter or a digit.



You program should consist of a single class, Password, that accepts a password string and checks it against the rules.

It should report whether a password is “good” or “bad” and if “bad”, why.

/*
Output
---------------------------------------------------------------
Password: RedCat

Password not long enough.

Password must have at least one digit.

Password must have at least one special character.



Password: Yellow22Dog

Password must have at least one special character.



Password: &P1nk2$2Fr0g

Hint:  Use the Character wrapper class.
