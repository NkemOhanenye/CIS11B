Write a Java solution to produce the truth table for any logic circuit and determine circuit equivalence.

You solution MUST contain

-   Two dimensional array
-   All necessary methods, e.g. tostring(), equal(), compareTo() etc.
-   Input and Ouput as needed
-   GUI (Chapter 13)
-   This will be 20% of the portfolio grade (TBD)

During labs, we will demonstrate the circuit concept with the "FULL ADDER" circuit.
