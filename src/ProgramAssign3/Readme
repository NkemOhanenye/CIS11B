Santa’s Helper

You are head Elf in Santa’s IT department.
Santa needs to load his sleigh and you have been asked to help with a new computerized inventory system.

Request for toys are received daily and each child is checked in the NaughtyOrNice (NON) database.

If a child was Naughty, Santa fills their stocking with coal, otherwise they will receive the gifts requested.

Each gift will be assigned to a child and all, but coal, will be given a tracking number (for inventory purposes).

Your program should:

-   read a “Letter to Santa”
-   check the database for NON status
-   load the sleigh with the appropriate gift(s)
-   calculate the gross flying weight (weight of all gifts + Santa)
-   As a design, you should have A gift class, A Toy class, A few Specific Types of Toys,
                    An Elf class (of which Santa is a member) and a Weightable Interface.

You should write a method that takes Weightable objects and calculates the gross weight.

After each delivery, you should report the current weight of the sleigh.
